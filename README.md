AI Receptionist / AI Employee platform for service businesses
AI Receptionist / AI Employee platform for service businesses. The system must handle inbound calls and SMS for natural conversations, and integrate with whatever booking/payment system each client already uses (e.g., Square, Calendly, Stripe, Fresha). Core features include booking creation, SMS confirmations with payment links, + auto SMS, an admin dashboard (business configs, services, logs, metrics), and multi-tenant support. Iâ€™ve prepared a full specification document that clearly outlines all requirements, tech stack, deliverables, and timeline
